# 20 minutes website design chalange

Here is the design, you have to finish it within 20 minutes 
Note:
- 10 mins means bare essentials
- Don't overthink colors, spacing, etc, it exists = good enough
- It's easy to under-estimate how much works is involved in making designs
- Accept that not all things have to be perfect
- Spending 20 minutes to design something is better than spending 1 hour thinking about it and not doing it.
